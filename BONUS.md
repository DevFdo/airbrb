- For Feature set 2: Coded it in such a manner that when user provides a thubnail image for listing that is shown or else a placeholder image is shown for all listings without a thumbnail even if the user uploads images. Added the feature such that if user does provide a thumbnail and other images are uploaded then I created a slider where upon loading the page the thumbnail image is shown but the user is able to go to next or previous image in the listing card itself without having to click on details. Upon discussion with my tutor, this has been mentioned to be a valid bonus feature.
